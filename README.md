# ChatGPT - Your Own Personal Talking Machine!

Are you tired of talking to your cat and getting no response? Well, worry no more! With ChatGPT, you can finally have a conversation with a machine that actually talks back!

ChatGPT is a conversational AI chatbot built with Python and the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/). This chatbot offers an interactive and entertaining experience for users, allowing them to have a conversation with a machine that generates coherent and relevant responses.

The ChatGPT model utilized by ChatGPT is the `gpt-3.5-turbo`, which is the same model used in OpenAI's ChatGPT product. This model is 10 times more cost-effective than OpenAI's existing GPT-3.5 models, priced at $0.002 per 1k tokens. It is also optimized for various non-chat use cases and has been tested successfully by early adopters.

The OpenAI API used by ChatGPT has been specifically designed for chatbots, consuming a sequence of messages along with metadata instead of unstructured text. The input is still processed by the model as a sequence of tokens, using a new format called Chat Markup Language (ChatML).

## Usage

To use ChatGPT, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Obtain an API key from OpenAI by signing up for an account on their website and creating a new API key.

2. Store the API key in a file named `openaiapikey.txt`.

3. Run the script using the following command in your terminal: `python chatbot.py`

4. Upon running the script, you will be prompted to specify the size of your chatbot.

5. Start chatting with your chatbot! The chatbot will generate responses based on your inputs in real-time.
